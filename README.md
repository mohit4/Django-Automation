### Introduction

Django is an open source full stack web application development framework packed with many amazing utilites that combined together gives a modern developer the ability to create a craft in minimum amount of time. Even though some power is already packed inside, sometimes we rely on automation to boost our productivity. This repository is created for one sole purpose, to explore the areas that can be automated and bring together power scripts and programs in one place so the end-user, in our case, the developer can benefit from it tremendously.
